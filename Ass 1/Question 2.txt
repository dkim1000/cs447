Question 2
a) 
test: x = [1,2,3,4,5]
expected:  3

b)
test: x = [-1,2,3,4,5]
expected: 3
actual: 2

c)
test: x = [-1,2,2147483648,4,5]
expected: 2
actual: error

d)
Error State
x = [-10, -9, 0, 99, 100]
i = 1
count = 0
PC = first iteration of if

Complete State
x = [-10, -9, 0, 99, 100]
i = 4
count = 1
PC = first iteration of if
